# AIcrafts

## What I'm Creating?

AIcrafts is an innovative e-commerce platform that focuses on selling customizable T-shirts. Users can choose from a
curated selection of pre-designed shirts available in the store. Additionally, they have the option to unleash their
creativity using an intuitive editor on the website to design their own personalized T-shirts. What sets AIcrafts apart
is the integration of artificial intelligence, allowing users to generate unique designs through language models.

## Why I'm Creating This?

The aim of AIcrafts is to provide a dynamic and engaging shopping experience for users who seek both curated and
personalized T-shirt designs. By combining the power of Django and Vue.js, the platform aims to offer a seamless and
user-friendly interface for designing and purchasing custom T-shirts.

## How I'm Creating This?

### Backend (Django/DRF):

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.

### Frontend (Vue.js):

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, providing a reactive and efficient way to
  create interactive web applications.

### Database:

- **SQLite (Development)**: Lightweight and easy to set up for development purposes.
- **PostgreSQL (Production)**: A robust, open-source relational database system for scalability and performance.

### Authentication:

- **Django Allauth**: An integrated set of Django applications addressing authentication, registration, account
  management, and more.

### AI Integration:

- **IN PROGRESS**:
